# PLDCreator

A project log document is a project management tool used for tracking project tasks.

For the moment **PLDCreator** can only handle JSON file as an input and HTML file as an output.
## Build

To build this project install [xmake](https://xmake.io/#/)

Then run 
```bash
  xmake
```
## Run

Once you have compiled the project you can run it (`xmake run PLDCreator`). 
Under `build/$(platform)/$(arch)/$(mod)` folder you will find the new file `pld.html` open it to show the `PLD` generated by `PLDCreator`

## Documentation

Open the `config.json` file

```json
{
    "PLDJsonFile": "./pld.json",
    "ModulesPath": "./modules/",
    "OutputType": "HTML",
    "Filename": "pld.html",
}
```
`PLDJsonFile` is the json file to be converted.

`ModulesPath` is the path where the modules are located.

`OutputType` is the name of the module that will perform the conversion.

`Filename` is the name of the generated file.



### Modules

#### HTML

This module allow you to convert your Json file into an HTML file.

In the `config.json` file we have to add new elements.

```json
"CssPath": "./assets/style.css",
"HtmlPrefix": "./assets/prefix",
"HtmlSufix": "./assets/suffix",
"Tags": {
    "UserStories": {
        "Section": [
            "<h1>",
            "</h1>"
        ],
        "Name": [
            "<h2>",
            "</h2>"
        ],
        "EstimatedTime": [
            "<p>",
            "</p>"
        ],
        "Description": [
            "<h3>",
            "</h3>"
        ],
        "DescriptionText": [
            "<p>",
            "</p>"
        ],
        "AsA": [
            "<p>",
            "</p>"
        ],
        "IWant": [
            "<p>",
            "</p>"
        ],
        "DoD": {
            "Section": [
                "<h3>",
                "</h3>"
            ],
            "Description": [
                "<p>",
                "</p>"
            ],
            "Bullets": {
                "list": [
                    "<ul>",
                    "</ul>"
                ],
                "listElement": [
                    "<li>",
                    "</li>"
                ]
            }
        }
    }
}
```

`CssPath` is the path to your CSS file that will be appened at the top of the HTML file.

`HtmlPrefix` is the path of an HTML file that will be appened before the PLD content.

`HtmlSufix` is the path of an HTML file that will be appened after the PLD content.

`Tags` is used to enclose all the text of the PLD, for example `EstimatedTime` will be enclose with `<p>EstimatedTime: 2 J/H</p>`
